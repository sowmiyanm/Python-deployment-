Developer - Motorola IMS Converged Services Gateway (CSG) for Seamless\\n      Mobility (as a consultant from Wipro Technologies to Motorola Inc.\\n      Bangalore) (From Aug 2005 to Feb 2008)\\n\\n\\n    . The Motorola IMS-CSG is a component, used to connect the IMS packet\\n      switching domain to a circuit switched network such as the Public\\n      Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).\\n    . Handled sanity testing and delivery of complete builds. Also worked on\\n      Rational Purify to improve the performance of the code (to reduce the\\n      number of core dumps). During this activity I fixed various memory\\n      related issues such as Free Memory Read (FMR), Array bound read (ABR),\\n      memory leaks etc.\\n    . Worked on a feature to provide fault-tolerance to the IPMH (IP message\\n      handler) process in the application. This process is the entry point\\n      of any SIP, Diameter etc messages in the CSG (Converged Services\\n      Gateway). Also worked on implementing the OFFER/ANSWER model for SDP\\n      exchange.\\n    . Worked on SIP (Session initiation protocol), IMS (IP Multimedia\\n      Subsystem) and various other protocols during this project.\\n      Programming in C and data structures. Used to working with debugging\\n      tools like GDB.\\n\\n\\n\\n
